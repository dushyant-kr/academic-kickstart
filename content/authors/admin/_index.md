A student at RMIT University studying Master of Data Science. With over 4 years of experience in the analytics industry I have often thought of use cases to prevent the spread of misinformation. Reading contradicting pieces of text over the internet in not uncommon and having developed a habit of investigative reading i strive to use my data science expertise to improve the dynamics of information flow.
